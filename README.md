tradition neural networks are commannaly limited by the memorizational system and the firm structure. As a result, we are aiming to create a brilliant new neural 
network which is not only able to memory key datas as a man, but also able to study new structure by awaring the weakness of the current structure.

we hope the new neural network can sturct itself.
